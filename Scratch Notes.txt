CS using nonlinear reconstruction techniques.
CS works using non adaptive random measurements.
The acquisition model.
Signal length n and random length m and use a random m x n matrix (measurement matrix). Few more things to be considered.
Reconstruction model
Using a reconstruction matrix with the generated vector from acquisition model
Usage of sparse coeff vector of length n
Using Lo optimisation which is NP hard
Using L1 minimization using linear programming.
Necessary conditions for perfect recovery (can we get rid of them)
Restricted isometry property
Incoherency between the measurement basis and sparse basis
Measurement matrices has gaussian distribution. Use of structured matrices.
Acquisition techniques:
Random demodulator
Modulated wideband controller
Random Modulation Pre-Integrator
Random Filtering
Random convolution
Compressive Multiplexing
Random Equivalent Sampling
Random Triggering-based Modulated Wideband Compressive Sampling
Quadrature Analog to information Converter.
Reconstruction techniques:
Convex Optimisation Techniques
Basis pursuit
Denoising using convex approach
Solvers for complex approach
Greedy Approach
Serial greedy
Parallel greedy
Threshold Approach
Iterative hard thresholding algorithm
Iterative soft thresholding algorithm
Approximate message passing algorithm
Combinatorial Approach
Non-convex approach
Bayesian Approach
